How to build code under mingw

Disclames: This instrustions worked for me at one time.

1. Install mingw with mingw-get-setup.exe to C:\MinGW 
- Install compiler/binutils from "MinGW Installation Manager".
- Install mingw32-libz. 
- DO NOT install msys-libopenssl. The library is build against
cygwin libc, which makes it incompatible with mingw standard libraries.

2. Post-install steps for build environment
- Download mintty-1.1.3-msys.zip , and put mintty.exe from there to C:\MinGW\bin
- Add the line 
-------
C:\MinGW   /mingw
-------
to C:\MinGW\msys\1.0\etc\fstab 
- Add the lines
-------
export CFLAGS="-I/mingw/include -I/usr/include"
export LDFLAGS="-L/mingw/lib -L/usr/lib"
export CC=gcc
export CPP=g++
--------
to the end of C:\MinGW\msys\1.0\etc\profile 
(Actually, I have added CC, and CPP lines after building libraries
at steps 3, an 4. It can make a difference for the 3, and 4)

If the enviroment is all set,  running:

C:\MinGW\msys\1.0\msys.bat --mintty
gives command line environment with 
gcc, make, perl (TBD: check what else is needed)

3. Build/install openssl
- Download the file openssl-1.0.1i.tar.gz, extract its content, and cd to the
directory, where it is extracted to in the above environment.
- From the evnironemnt run the commands:
-----------
./Configure -DHAVE_STRUCT_TIMESPEC -L/mingw/lib -lz -lws2_32 --prefix=/mingw zlib mingw
make
make install
----------
Ensure there are no errors on the screen. Check that file C:\MinGW\lib\libssl.a 
appears after the 'make install' command.

4. Build/install libssh2.
- Download libssh2-1.4.3.tar.gz, extract it, and cd to the and cd to the
directory, where it is extracted to in the above environment.
- From the evnironemnt run the commands:
--------------
./configure --prefix=/mingw --with-libz --with-openssl --disable-examples-build
make
make install
--------------
Ensure there are no errors on the screen. Check that file C:\MinGW\lib\libssh2.a
appears after the 'make install' command.

Now you should be GTG to build Wal Commander with SSH support 
by runnung 'make' in wcm directory
